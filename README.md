My submission for the Data Structures & Algorithms portion of the Semester 4 midterm Sprint.
This was built with the concept of a 'current' user - task creation and completion applies to the current user, and other users can be made the current user after they are created.
I opted to use a HashMap to store the users.

To use this project, simply compile all files and then run the Main class.
